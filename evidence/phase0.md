# Phase 0 feasibility evidence

## Verdict

**PASS** — the complete classifier output agrees with the restored graph, both generated import files, package contents, and the committed corpus matrix.

The probe reads only reachable entries from `project.assets.json`; it does not restore, evaluate MSBuild, load dependency assemblies, start analysis processes, or query a feed.

## Per-category comparison

| Capability | Package | Relationship | Context | TFM/RID | Seeded | Classified | `project.assets.json` | `.nuget.g.props` | `.nuget.g.targets` | Package contents | Proven sources | Disagreement |

## Missing classifier entries

None.

## Unexpected classifier entries

None.

## Disagreements

None.

## Corpus matrix

The committed combination matrix is [fixtures/corpus-matrix.md](../fixtures/corpus-matrix.md).

## Reproducibility and safety environment

`NUGET_PACKAGES=.phase0/packages`
Controlled package source: `.phase0/feed`, configured by `NuGet.config`.
The classifier receives already restored assets and generated import files. The phase script performs restore only to create fixture evidence.

## Generated-import condition grammar

The classifier proves unconditional imports, `$(TargetFramework)` equality/inequality comparisons including empty and non-empty string values, and boolean `AND`/`OR` composition with parentheses.
It proves the standard `$(ExcludeRestorePackageImports) != 'true'` restore guard and the standard `Exists('$(NuGetPackageRoot)/<resolved-package-suffix>')` package-file guard when the import path matches the reachable asset.
Conditions on `ImportGroup` and `Import` elements, including nested groups, are combined as a conjunction and evaluated for each target framework or project context.
Conditions on arbitrary properties such as `Configuration`, unsupported `Exists(...)` expressions, unknown functions, malformed expressions, and any other clause outside this grammar are unproven, carry a specific reason, and make analysis incomplete. Incomplete analysis exits 2 from the probe and cannot be a clean result.
Raw fixture binary hashes are intentionally not recorded: compiler/packaging outputs can vary with host and SDK details. Deterministic evidence is the pinned SDK, resolved package/file presence, package-relative paths, direct/transitive relationships, target/RID context, active/inactive state, generated-import comparison, and gate verdict.
